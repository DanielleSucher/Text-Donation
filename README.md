I'm disappointed that Twilio doesn't allow what they call spoofing - you can't specify a from_number that isn't a Twilio number, so I can't forward a text to a random charity directly. So instead, if you text 347-756-4559 with '5' or '10', it will send back the phone number and code to donate that amount to a random charity off the list.


Please let me know if you come across any charities that don't work, or any that should be on the list but aren't. Thanks!
